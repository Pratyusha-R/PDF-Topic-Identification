# PDF-Topic-Identification
The project involves creating a web application that allows users to upload a PDF file. The application then extracts the text from the PDF, preprocesses it, and uses a machine learning model to identify the topic of the document. The result is displayed back to the user on the web interface. 

Components of the Project
Backend:

Flask: A micro web framework used to handle HTTP requests and responses.
PyMuPDF: A library used to extract text from PDF files.
NLTK: A library for natural language processing used for text preprocessing.
Transformers: A library by Hugging Face used to load pre-trained machine learning models for text classification.
Frontend:

HTML: Markup language to create the structure of the web pages.
Bootstrap: A CSS framework to style the web pages and make them responsive.
CSS: Custom styling to enhance the appearance of the web pages.
